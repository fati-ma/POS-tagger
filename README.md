# POS-tagger

This is a POS tagging system project, built manually (as a future library).
It is built using Python language, Pycharm IDE, Excel workbooks.

**part-of-speech tagging** (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. 

This system was built to be tested on **Arabic Language**.

Parts of speech: 
1- Verbs
2- Nouns
3- Particle

## How to use it

1- Clone the repo
2- Open your Python IDE
3- Run the project

And it has the functions you can do on this text:
